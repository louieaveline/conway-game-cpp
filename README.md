# conway-game-cpp

A terminal-based implementation of Conway's Game of Life using C++. This project simulates a 2D grid of cells evolving over time based on simple rules, with support for classic patterns and toroidal edge wrapping. Built for learning and demonstration purposes.

## üß† What is the Game of Life?

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. It's a zero-player simulation: you set the initial state, and the system evolves automatically.

Each cell in the grid can be either **alive** or **dead**, and its state changes according to these rules:

1. Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors survives.
2. Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive.
3. All other cells die or remain dead.

## üöÄ How to Use

After compiling, run the program and enter the grid configuration in this format:

```
<rows> <cols> <pattern>
```

Or type `help` to list available options.
